Our search strategy enabled us to identify published and unpublished literature by focusing on relevant academic and institutional databases, citation tracking, and snowballing of references. For searches of electronic databases, we used a detailed search string. To capture both quantitative studies for answering Research Question 1 and qualitative and mixed-methods literature relevant to Research Questions 2 and 3, we did not include search strings for study design, comparison condition, or outcome measures. Using these criteria in the search strategy would have excluded relevant qualitative studies, as well as quantitative and mixed-methods studies that omitted this information from the title and abstract. Appendix 1 provides an example of a search string. Each search string was adapted to fit the syntax of the database host in order to utilize Boolean operators (AND/OR), wildcards, truncation, and other database search features.

The primary search included 11 general databases and 12 databases that specialize in literature relevant to development economics and labour market issues. The search terms used for the primary search were based on the inclusion criteria and tried to strike a balance between sensitivity (e.g., finding all available articles in a topic area) and specificity (e.g., finding only relevant articles). For electronic databases with advanced search functions, the preferred search was based on a search of exposure, outcome and subject terms using Boolean operators in title and abstract from 2000 onwards. Highly relevant databases, such as EconLit, were searched for studies published since 1990 in order to include potentially relevant studies between 1990 and 2000. The search terms for electronic databases and examples for RePEc/IDEAS, EconLit and ERIC are presented in Sections 9.6.3 and 9.6.4 of the Appendix. The search strategy was modified according to the specifications of each database. Wherever possible, synonyms as well as wildcards and truncation symbols were applied as appropriate. The use of synonyms also accounted for British or American English spelling. To account for terminology differences across disciplines, database thesauri were consulted to ensure that all appropriate synonyms were included. Where available, the team also relied on the database’s index terms and/or free-text terms. For databases or websites with basic search functions, the review team adjusted the search terms to accommodate the limited functionality of search functions and adapted these customized search strategies to relevant keyword searches and/or topic/theme searches based on the test results of keyword combinations of search terms. The search of electronic databases was completed in February 2014. From November 2014 to January 2015, the review team contacted experts and authors of included studies, screened reference lists of included studies and conducted citation tracking in order to identify additional studies.

The hand-searching strategy was customized for each relevant institutional website. Search terms were used for websites that included a search facility. Otherwise, relevant sections (for example, “documents” or “publications”) were searched. Websites of conferences that were deemed relevant to the research question were searched for potentially relevant studies. To include potentially relevant dissertations and theses that were not indexed in bibliographic databases, the review team searched national and international dissertation and thesis databases. The review team also conducted citation tracking and screened reference lists of included studies and relevant existing reviews and meta-analyses to identify further studies for inclusion. The review team contacted authors of previous reviews and included studies, as well as experts and individuals coordinating youth employment related topics in relevant institutions, to ask whether they knew of any studies that might be applicable in addition to the studies that were included after the full text review of full reports.

The search strategy used to search ProQuest is outlined in Table 3.1. Beyond including charter and charter schools in the search, we included specific brands of charter schools in the United States, such as KIPP, Rocketship Education, and Great Hearts. To identify international studies, we used the search terms free, paternalistic, autonomous, foundation, and academies. Through extensive scoping searches, we found these to be the most common terms used for charter schools internationally. We suspected the term free school would draw a particularly diverse swath of irrelevant studies, including literature related to smoke-free schools, free school meals, and the Free School Movement. Thus, we excluded those terms from the title search. To ensure comprehensive inclusion of relevant studies, we limited search terms about design and outcomes to only the broadest terms. While we hoped to target well-described studies with terms such as lottery, propensity, or experiment*, we also included terms such as match*, compar*, and control* to target studies that do not describe their methodology in great detail.

We searched the following databases from 1980 to March 2016:

• 3ie Impact Evaluation Database

• Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA, ProQuest)

• Cochrane CENTRAL issue 2 of 12, February 2016

• EMBASE (OVID)

A sensitive search strategy based on existing search strategies from existing WASH systematic reviews, our ToC and our selection criteria, was developed by an information specialist and tested in an iterative way for each database separately. A combination of index terms (where relevant) and free text words (in title/abstract) was used, with attention to possible synonyms and words used in key papers. De-duplication of the references was done by the information
specialist using Reference Manager 12. All searches, search dates, and number of references found per database are documented in Appendix 3 (search strategies) and 4 (search report).; A comprehensive search was conducted to identify both published and unpublished studies.

A single general search strategy was used to find both quantitative and qualitative studies for RQ1 and RQ2, however, this was adapted to each database and website searched. For each database, we studied its thesaurus and customised our general strategy accordingly, including the appropriate vocabulary. For websites, which tend to have much more limited searching facilities, multiple targeted searches were conducted using selected key words from the general search strategy. Our basic search strategy was adapted to each database, combining text terms with indexing terms using Boolean (AND /OR) and proximity (NEAR/WITHIN/ADJ) operators: ‘[population terms] AND [intervention terms] ‘.  All customised search strategies were piloted in order to assess their relevance and precision, and to identify the most optimal set of search terms. We prioritised high sensitivity of the search terms over precision in order to avoid omitting relevant studies which do not report sufficient information in their title or abstract. Reviewers were over-inclusive during the first stages of screening titles and abstracts…. All the searches, including hand searches, were documented and a detailed record of the type of search (i.e. electronic, hand-searching, etc), specific search strategy, number of references retrieved, date of search and search source is available upon request. For the main database searches, the examples of the search strings and dates are given in Annex A, as is an example of our hand-searching strings and search methods.

Much of published material on certification schemes, especially those related to ethical trading, is produced by certification bodies, as well as by activists and NGOs seeking to further ethical trade. We therefore invested considerable time and effort in moving beyond the standard social science databases and including less commonly searched specialist databases, as well as potential sources of grey literature, such as the website of certification bodies, NGOs and research institutes. Several organisations also maintain large, but not public, archives of impact studies, but we were only successful in accessing these in a small number of cases.

Finally, we covered relevant websites and databases of studies German, Portuguese and in Spanish. This required the targeted selection of relevant databases, especially for Latin America (such as Scielo) and websites associated with evaluations of interventions in agricultural production, including standards, in non-English language.42 We did not search specific French-language databases but did consider French-language material discovered during our searches for inclusion. We searched the following non-English language databases: • SCIELO [Portuguese & Spanish], 03/12/2015 (http://www.scielo.org/php/index.php); • GESIS SOWPORT [German], 19/11/2015 (http://sowiport.gesis.org).

Websites and specialist databases were searched in a flexible manner that combined the search process with screening for inclusion. The search process had to be flexible due to the wide variation in functionality across websites. Some have reasonably well-developed search functions, while others have to be browsed by keywords, or even browsed in their entirety. For each website, the search function was tested first using a list of relevant keywords. If the search function proved satisfactory in terms of returning potentially relevant material, then this function was used. If not, as was commonly the case, the website was browsed by keywords or content categories. If these were not available, the website's publications (or similar) sections were browsed. Potentially relevant studies were then screened via title and abstract and a partial review of the text.

Our general/starting-point search terms for this meta-analysis include those used by Cooper et al. (2003), augmented by terms used in pertinent research published after that meta-analysis. The basic form of the search terms is: “year-round school*” or “year-round education” or (school AND (“alternative calendar” or “modified calendar” or “balanced calendar”) or (“year-round calendar” AND school). We modified the precise terms, phrases, and Boolean operators to take advantage of the search features, index terms identified in the resource’s thesaurus, and tools within each of 22 specific search/retrieval resource. Searches were restricted to studies dated 2001–2016, to avoid duplicative inclusion of studies that were in the Cooper et al. (2003) work. As searching was conducted, records were saved in Excel for each search result, which allows for clear indication of which results were found by each database/tool (for both sources found in multiple sources, and for unique results).

Through this process, we selected the most relevant databases for our review. The primary requirement for selected databases—ability to search the full database—is critical to ensure that the selection process was impartial. For example, Google Scholar is a source of unpublished or “grey” literature. However, it does not provide an interface that allows for a systematic search and retrieval of all potentially relevant documents. Rather, the query yields only the top results as defined by the Google search algorithm. After selecting appropriate databases, the team drafted, tested, and refined the initial search queries overall and by database specifications to identify the search string that best captured the most potentially relevant evidence for the population, topic, and time frame of interest. The systematic review team constructed a database query by identifying search terms using the population criteria. To capture both quantitative studies for answering Research Question 1, qualitative intervention and nonintervention relevant to Research Question 3, and quantitative nonintervention research relevant to Research Question 2, we did not include search strings for study design, comparison condition, or outcome measures. Using these criteria in the search strategy would have excluded relevant qualitative studies, as well as quantitative and mixed‐methods studies that omitted this information from the title and abstract. The terms below represent the keywords and phrases that were identified for our English search. Their equivalents in the other target languages are listed in Table 1.",yes,"To ensure we captured all of the relevant and applicable literature in the region, we reviewed the bibliographies of accepted articles and reports to identify relevant and high-quality studies that might fit our criteria.

those from the wider LAC region—and asked them to provide

Our search strategy identified published as well as unpublished literature, first, via electronically searching 12 bibliographic databases and, second, by searching additional grey literature sources such as selected websites, repositories, and research registers. We also manually searched targeted journals and reference lists and contacted key researchers in the field of autism to inquire about studies.

(2020), based on a previously published protocol for the EGM (Miller, Ordonez, et al., 2017). A confimatory search for this SR, led us to identify an error in the initial EGM search string. To address this issue, we conducted an additional search with the corrected search string. These changes are documented in Appendix A. The search details, including a list of the databases and organizational websites and the example full search string, are provided in Appendix A. The databases that we searched for publications were: SCOPUS EBSCO: Econlit OVID: Agricola Web of Science: Core Collection Web of Science: CAB Abstracts and Global Health AGRIS The search terms used in each database are shown in Table A1 (constructed using the terms from CAB thesaurus and using the research group's specific knowledge). Each search string included each of the agroforestry practices from Table 3. These terms and search strings were modified through a scoping exercise in Web of Science, SCOPUS, and EBSCO, where the search terms were used, and the results were evaluated by analyzing the relevance of the first 50 studies. We note that the intervention types are more generic, including topics well beyond agroforestry, so our search focused on practices. We included an LMIC filter to identify only studies in relevant countries, shown in the last row of Table 5, which was used in Lopez‐Avila et al. (2017) based on World Bank country classification by income in 2017, when our search was conducted. Specific search strings for the databases are shown in Table A2. In conducting this SR, we identified errors in the search strings used in the earlier EGM for the Scopus and Agricola databases. We corrected the search strings for these databases in this SR, and we researched and screened the additional studies that we had missed. This process allowed us to identify three additional impact evaluations in the Agricola database (no additional relevant studies were identified in the Scopus database).",yes,"Additionally, in order to identify the existing grey literature, the websites of various organizations that are likely to produce published and unpublished research were searched.

This list was validated with the external EGM advisory group. To optimize the scope of the search while ensuring transparency in our methods, we followed the approach developed by Haddaway et al. (2017), which allowed us to search multiple websites simultaneously and to extract the relevant information from each website into a single database.

The current review considered all studies from the Egli et al. (2009) review, in addition to studies independently selected by the authors of the current review. For criminal justice outcomes the authors considered all studies published between January 1, 2007 and October 31, 2020 as this portion of the review was an update of the Egli et al. (2009) study. For overdose outcomes the authors considered any study published between January 1, 1960 through October 31, 2020. Thus, any studies published on or after November 1, 2020 were not included in this review. In contrast to the original review, only studies published in English were considered for the current review, as the author team did not have sufficient bi- or multi-lingual individuals to have two independent coders per study in another language. All searches were conducted by the first author between May 7, 2021 and June 23, 2021 (see Supporting Information Appendix 1 for database-specific dates).

In particular, we electronically searched databases and research registries, took steps to capture grey literature, hand searched relevant journals, and reviewed reference lists of recent reviews of SM interventions. Rationale for selecting electronic databases and other online resources was based on consultation with university library staff, reviewing search methods used in previous relevant meta-analyses and Campbell Reviews, and our research team's experiences with conducting large-scale reviews. Relevant studies were identified through electronic searches of academic databases and research registries. The following electronic databases and research registries were searched: 1) Electronic databases a. Academic Search Premier (EBSCOhost, 1911-present) b. Medline (EBSCOhost, 1946-present) c.

Our methodology for the grey literature search followed a systematic approach:

    1.

    First, a list of the most common variants of the intervention terms should be extrapolated based on any scoping work and existing studies for inclusion identified. Considering the broad aspect of our review we used a short set of terms related to gender equality and women's empowerment.
    2.

    The strategy differs for sites with more or less than 300 resources. First, any relevant filters within the specific site should be applied (e.g., choosing only relevant document types, sectors, etc.).
        a.

        For repositories with more than 300 resources:
            i.

            Each search term is run alongside the methodology term ‘IE’ and ‘impact assessment’ for a total of 10 searches per site (women, men, girls, boys and gender).
            ii.

            Screen results until no potentially relevant results are identified on two consecutive pages of 50 search results (i.e., 100 excludes in a row).

        b.

        For repositories with fewer than 300 resources:
            i.

            Only the methodology term ‘IE’ is searched.
            ii.

            Screen all results.

    3.

    For all sites, where possible, display settings are set to show 50 results per page, and the first page of results gets printed to PDF. Each set of PDFs gets saved in a folder with the site name and date of search, and the search data get recorded in a master Excel file as follows:
        a.

        For each website searched, the following information should be recorded:
            i.

            the date of the search;
            ii.

            the specific URL of the website searched (e.g., to differentiate between a search of publications vs. a search of programmes, which on J-PAL's website will return different results);
            iii.

            the specific search terms used in each search (e.g., 1: IE; 2: ‘IE’; 3… etc.);
            iv.

            the number of hits for each search result (which can be recorded in a single cell with a formula, =[no. results from first search] +  [no. results from second search]+…+[no. results from nth search]);
            v.

            the number of potentially relevant documents identified and uploaded to EPPI, recorded by search as in (iv)

    4.

    For each set of results, the titles and any abstract information shown on the main page are screened for potential inclusion, and if clearly irrelevant based on intervention, methodology or population, are ignored.
