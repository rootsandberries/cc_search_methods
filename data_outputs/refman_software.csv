"2","Titles and abstracts of the search results from database, grey literature, and citation searches were uploaded to the EPPI-Reviewer 4 online system"
"3","All relevant documents meeting search criteria were catalogued in an EPPI-Reviewer database"
"5","""the candidate studies located in their respective channels were imported to Endnote (The EndNote Team, 2013) and organized in separate folders. From there, the references were imported into the internet-based software Distiller SR (Evidence Partners, Ottawa, Canada)."""
"6","The search results used to identify a broad set of potentially relevant qualitative and quantitative empirical studies as well as conceptual papers on contract farming were stored in EPPI Reviewer 4. Each upload indicates the source and search terms used in search-specific RIS-files."
"7","""After removing duplicates in the reference management software EndNote, screening of 28,375 records by title and abstract was carried out by individual reviewers"""
"11","De-duplication of the references was done by the information specialist using Reference Manager 12."
"13","""We used the EPPI-Reviewer 4 bibliographic software (Thomas et al, 2010) to manage retrieved references."""
"16","This information was stored in a Reference Manager database."
"18","The results of each search were imported into EndNote reference management software where the initial title and abstract screening took place."
"21","References identified through database and grey literature searching were screened independently, in duplicate by two members of the research team using Covidence software."
"23","Zotero, a reference management software program was used to retrieve, store, and document the search process. Each database had its own file folder within Zotero and was searched individually."
"25","All studies retrieved from our search were inputted to Endnote and then duplicate records were removed."
"28","Endnote X7 software was used to manage references, citations and documents. Data extracted to characterise studies was inputted in STATA v.13 in order to produce inferential/descriptive statistics. Effect sizes were inputted in Version 3.0 of the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software."
"31","As outlined in the protocol, titles were reviewed initially in Endnote by the lead author to remove any studies which were clearly irrelevant...Reasons for exclusion were independently reported by both reviewers in 
the ‘research notes’ field within endnote reference manager."
"32","All bibliographic information was exported into an Endnote database and managed from there"
"33","A total of 9,102 references from all searches were imported to Covidence
 for title and abstract screening. After removal of 1,929 duplicates, 
7,173 titles/abstracts were screened by one reviewer and 7,106 reports 
were excluded."
"34","All search results were imported into EPPI-Reviewer 4 and duplicates removed."
"38","Search results were merged using EndNote and duplicate records of the same publication/report were removed."
"39","We imported all search results into EPPI‐Reviewer 4 (version4.7.1.0"
"41","they mentioned using Excel"
"43","References were imported to EndNote for a duplication test. Since the Bielefeld Academic Search Engine (BASE) and Google Scholar does not allow for advanced search strings and result in a large number of hits, we chose to include the first 500 hits in each database for further screening. Of these, 94 references were immediately excluded because of clear irrelevance before importing references to the EndNote library (this was done because the importation of references from these databases to the EndNote library was less straightforward than for the other databases)."
"44","In the grey literature section of Appendix C, Mendeley is mentioned a few times in this way: ""References imported into Mendeley-database: 177.  References imported to EPPI-reviewer after duplication in Mendeley: 171.""; The results of all of the electronic searches were combined into a master database on a software database specifically designed for processing studies in a SR: EPPI Reviewer 4"
"45","We stored all the references identified by the search in EndNote 
software (Version X7). We recorded (in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet) 
all websites searched and the details of any reports found or further 
contacts made. When screening full papers, we used the EPPI-Reviewer 4 
(V.4.5.0.1) software to keep records of all eligibility decisions."
"47","We imported all citations found through the above search methods into the Mendeley reference management software (http://www.mendeley.com/). Mendeley automatically extracted bibliographic data from each book, article, or reference and removed all duplicates."
"48","All studies identified through the LSHTM and National Police Library search process were first exported to the EndNote bibliographic database for de-duplication"
"50","These documents were filtered for duplicates while conducting the searches, and we used Endnote (a bibliographic management software) to sort and identify further duplicates prior to beginning the review of the search results"
"52","We used the EPPI‐reviewer software to track the search and screening process"
"54","Bibliographic data and abstracts exported into EndNote (in protocol)"
"55","Following these search stages, potential titles and abstracts were imported into Endnote (a bibliographic reference software tool). Once duplicates were removed, the final two stages of the search strategy were conducted and any newly identified references (i.e., from agencies, experts or books) were also imported into Endnote. A second duplicate check was conducted once the literature from all stages were combined."
"58","""Then we ran the search for each intervention. We then combined both searches by using “AND” and kept the searches in a separate EndNote file."""
"59","In order to ensure replicability, all searches were stored into Covidence, an online software product developed by Cochrane community for screening studies and extracting data for systematic reviews."
"60","We used the EPPI‐reviewer software to track the search and screening process"
"61","We imported the records from academic databases into our data management software (EPPI-Reviewer 4), and we used the built-in tool to aid in removing duplicates. The grey literature was imported into and managed in Microsoft Excel due to reference format incompatibility with EPPI-Reviewer 4."
"67","Search results were downloaded in files that contained their full reference information, titles, and abstracts and subsequently imported into the EndNote X8 reference manager program"
"69","We imported all search results into EPPI-Reviewer 41 and removed duplicates"
"71","""We began by importing all search results into EPPI-Reviewer 4 (Thomas et al., 2010)"""
"72","Citations and abstracts were stored in a group library in Zotero, as were full text reports."
"73","Metadata for each study were imported into the Covidence online platform that provides an environment to manage and conduct systematic reviews.5"
"74","Once a full set of potentially relevant citations were identified, the authors received assistance from a Campbell Collaboration representative to de-duplicate the results using EndNote®. After de-duplication, all remaining citations were uploaded to DistillerSR® systematic review software."
"75","Independent screening and deduplication of identified records was carried out in EPPI-Reviewer 4 version 4.12.0.0."
"76","All citations located through searching procedures were imported into Mendeley reference management software (http://www.mendeley.com/). The use of Mendeley allowed us to automatically extract bibliographic data and abstracts from journal articles, book, and/or references. Additionally, we removed all duplicate citations once they were imported into Mendeley."
"78","We imported all search results into EPPI-Reviewer 4 (Thomas & Brunton, 2010) and removed duplicates through the EPPI-Reviewer 4 deduplication process."
"79","For each of the two rounds, the search results were saved in an electronic format using the reference manager software Endnotes"
"80","Independent screening and deduplication of identified records was carried out in EPPI-Reviewer 4 version 4.12.0.0."
"82","We exported the full set of search results directly into an Endnote X9 Library. Where this was not possible, search results were manually entered into the Endnote Library. The Endnote library made it easier to identify duplicates and manage references.
First, we exported search results from the various databases and search engines into an Endnote X9 software. Second, we searched for and removed duplicates using the Endnote software."
"84","We used Zotero to manage references and implement the search strategy below. In addition, we recorded the following information for each conducted search: the date of search, database/website searched, the final search syntax, any modifications or restrictions to the search string, the reported yield from the source, as well as the final yield of studies subsequently exported into Zotero. For database searches in particular, a reported yield would be different than what was exported to Zotero."
